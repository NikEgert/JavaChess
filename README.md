# Chess Game

## Description

A Java-based chess game with a focus on piece movement, threat detection, and game rules enforcement. This project aims to provide a functional chess game with features such as detecting threatened squares and handling piece movements and attacks.

## Features

- Move pieces according to chess rules.
- Detect threatened squares.
- Handle check and checkmate conditions.
- User-friendly interface for playing and interacting with the game board.

## Future plans

- Implementing an alternate gamemode Human vs AI
- Using an AI algorithm for the AI's moves
- cleaning up the code (as it is very messy at the moment)
